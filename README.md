üêæ VetMed


Description:
This Senior Capstone project involved developing a functional prototype website for a local business.
Our team selected a veterinary clinic and designed a tailored solution to support their operational needs.
The resulting product, VetMed, is a Windows Forms application built in C# that facilitates the management of veterinary medical records and integrates Twilio for SMS notifications.
While the application is currently a prototype, it is fully functional and ready for deployment should the client choose to adopt it.

Features:
Manage patient and appointment records

Send SMS notifications via Twilio

Local database using SQL Server LocalDB

Environment variables for secure credential storage

Getting Started:
Visual Studio 2022

.NET Framework

SQL Server LocalDB

Twilio account (for SMS features)
(Twilio account credentials have been omitted for security reasons. The code includes placeholders to allow users to add their own account information as needed.)
